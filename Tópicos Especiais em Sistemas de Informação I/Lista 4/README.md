## Requirements

Banking system requirements:

* Implement a graphical interface for the banking system that allows instantiating other windows of the system through the Menu widget.
* Implement graphical interfaces to register, show, and update the information of an instance of the Banco class.
* Create subclasses for the Conta class: ContaPoupanca and ContaCorrente. Savings accounts should have their balance updated monthly according to the bank's interest rate. Checking accounts should have a fixed discount on their balance, set by the bank, whenever a withdrawal or deposit occurs.
* Instances of the Conta and Cliente classes must have a unique and automatic identifier for each instance.
* Implement graphical interfaces to list and include instances of the ContaPoupanca, ContaCorrente, and Cliente classes.
* Create a functionality to close an account. An account can only be closed if its balance is zero.
* Create a functionality to remove an instance of the Cliente class. A client can only be removed if they are not linked to an account in the bank.
* Implement a graphical interface to update the data of an instance of the Cliente class.
* Implement graphical interfaces to perform withdrawal and deposit operations in instances of the ContaCorrente and ContaPoupanca classes. A closed account cannot perform withdrawals and deposits.
* Create a functionality to generate a report (statement of operations with withdrawals and deposits) of an account and save it in a file whose name will be the account number and the content should contain the date, type of operation, and value (separated by commas), in addition to the final balance of the account.
